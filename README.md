# Parallel-Programming
The Assignment completed in OpenCL and written in C++ for the Parallel Programming module of third year Computer Science. The task was to develop a digital image enhancement tool which will perform contrast adjustment using the histogram equalisation algorithm. The algorithm uses a cumulative intensity histogram to back-project original image intensities resulting in an image of equalised intensities.
